let object1 = {value: 10};
let object2 = object1;
let object3 = {value: 10};

console.log(object1 == object2);
// → true
console.log(object1 == object3);
// → false

object1.value = 15;
console.log(object2.value);
// → 15
console.log(object3.value);
// → 10

object2 value mutates as object1s value is changed. it's not the actual object as
the value its  the object reference.

The object1 and object2 bindings grasp the same object, which is why changing 
object1 also changes the value of object2. They are said to have the same identity. 
The binding object3 points to a different object, which initially contains the same 
properties as object1 but lives a separate life.


for (let i = 0; i < JOURNAL.length; i++) {
  let entry = JOURNAL[i];
  // Do something with entry
}
This kind of loop is common in classical JavaScript—going over arrays one element at a 
time is something that comes up a lot, and to do that you’d run a counter over the length 
of the array and pick out each element in turn.

There is a simpler way to write such loops in modern JavaScript.

for (let entry of JOURNAL) {
  console.log(`${entry.events.length} events.`);
}

The word 'of' after a var definition, loops over the elements of the value given after 'of'. 
Works for arrays strings and some other data structures.
